	<h4 class="content__text-4">The year was 1996, the 10th February, and the world was waiting for the clash of the century:
Kasparov against the supercomputer Deep Blue.
IBM, at that time, was the strongest and largest computer company, that released a hellish
machine capable - according to the creators - of beating World Chess Champion Garry
Kasparov.
It was not only a curious chess event, but even the beginning of the war man vs. machine.
Will the man take over the machine or will he be crushed? And if he loses, what will become
of humanity? Indeed, in the future we will be at the service of machines? Multiple
considerations were hidden behind the duel. How could a tangle of wires and buttons beat
the Grandmaster? Everyone was rooting for Kasparov and he himself had the certainty of
winning.
Despite the general confidence, the atmosphere was unusual, a lifeless enemy like Deep
Blue had something disturbing. When the meeting began, there was great silence in the
room.
The game began following orthodox opening rules and went smoothly until Kasparov
decided to abandon the “book moves'' route. But, little by little, the machine began to make
moves that put the world champion in the corner, forcing him to play uncertain moves, like
his desperate final attack . Exhausted, Kasparov abandoned, letting Deep Blue win the
match. </h4>

	<h4 class="content__text-4">
A year later, Kasparov decided to confront the IBM artifact again. Pre match predictions
were decidedly in the champion’s favor. Despite predictions based on his excellent skills and
predictive abilities, the situation turned out to be surprising starting from the very first match:
Kasparov stumbled in an unbalanced position and went on to a historic defeat.
The computer managed to hinder the great master’s plans during six grueling matches, thus
marking a decisive historical event: the first time one of the greatest human intelligences
had lost to a machine in a chess game.</h4>
